# Bach Chorale Dictionary
Bach Chorale Dictionary is a web-based platform for studying, analyzing, and practicing J.S. Bach’s four-part chorales.

This site provides structured access to chorale metadata, score rendering, audio playback, melodic search, cadence classification, soprano-phrase grouping, keyboard harmony practice, and ear-training exercises.
Chorale data is sourced from music21.corpus.chorales.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to offer an environment for learning Bach chorales:

- To explore chorales with searchable metadata

- To study cadences and phrase patterns

- To practice ear training and keyboard harmony

The platform is designed for composers, musicians, and anyone studying tonal harmony.
